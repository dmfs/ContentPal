/**
 * A {@link Projection} of columns joined from another table.
 * <p>
 * This can be used to create composite projections for views which join two or more tables. Instead of creating a new projection for the columns of the
 * original table in the view, this class allows it to use the original projection for the joined view.
 * <p>
 * A common example is the contact provider {@link ContactsContract.Data} table which also contains all columns of the {@link ContactsContract.RawContacts}
 * table.
 * <p>
 * Using {@link Joined}, it's possible to add all the {@link ContactsContract.RawContacts} columns to a projection on the {@link ContactsContract.Data} table.
 * <pre><code>
 * Projection&lt;Data&gt; projection =
 *     new Composite&lt;Data&gt;(
 *         new DataProjection(),
 *         new Joined&lt;RawContacts, Data&gt;(new RawContactsProjection()));
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * @param <Original>
 *     The table which the {@link Projection} originally belongs to
 * @param <JoinedView>
 *     The view which joins the original table and contains all its columns.
